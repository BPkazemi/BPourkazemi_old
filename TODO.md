# TODO
---
1. Add list of 'what I've read recently' (could be technical only or include 
books/audiobooks). 
This is difficult to keep up with, instead could have a "favorite books" section

## Thoughts & ideas
---
1) Use the CSS circle background from the Nassim Taleb visualization as the 
background for the page. 

2) Use Zurb Foundation 'Grid' template instead of HTML5UP.

3) Use collision detection somewhere, cause it's fucking awesome:

4) Modularize code with require.js, enhance workflow with SASS and Grunt
### Some advice to self:
---
Face a problem, or be downed by it.
(make a cool visualization with canvas = excuse to learn canvas)
